Where the story stands now is that we could make an equation for the curve of views if Youtube made the statistics accessible. With that we could somehow try to predict what future match ups would bring in terms of views. Before I get into that I want to note two things.

Putting a number to two names doesn't seem to be sufficient. This is evident by a battle like Hitman Holla vs. Conceited. Standing at about 1.5 million views, it is still below what you might have expected beforehand. It being a pretty bad battle must have some effect there.

Another thing to note is that good performances don't necessarily bring millions of views either. Illmaculate vs. Bigg K is somewhere above 3k despite all the hype around it when it came out probably peaking at many people and outlets naming it the battle of the year.

This number is not so surprising though if you look at other battles from these four that I mentioned. This is Bigg K's most viewed battle outside of Smack and has well over the views of an average Illmac battle (VerseTracker has him at a little over 1k).

A simple model for this can be constructed with the methods of game theory. The options would look something like this

<a href="http://www.codecogs.com/eqnedit.php?latex=\begin{pmatrix}&space;good,good&good,bad\\&space;bad,good&bad,bad&space;\end{pmatrix}" target="_blank"><img src="http://latex.codecogs.com/gif.latex?\begin{pmatrix}&space;good,good&good,bad\\&space;bad,good&bad,bad&space;\end{pmatrix}" title="\begin{pmatrix} good,good&good,bad\\ bad,good&bad,bad \end{pmatrix}" /></a>

Both do good, one of them does good or both do badly. From this the idea is that there are four possible outcomes which would lead to four possible beta's to predict this curve.
