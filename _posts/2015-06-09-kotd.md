title: KOTD calendar and match ups
---

As KOTD's birthday event WD5 is coming up, and announcements should start to drop soon, it is well worth it to go over what has been established since its inception. The first event happened in a park in Toronto, the first battled released was Tricky P vs HFK which recently had a [rematch](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=VTlamYIQvbg) on Ground Zero, the first headliner was between the former teammates yet still active later to be title holders poRICH vs Kid Twist. These are all names that most people will be familiar with but many have come and gone and it is hard to keep track of who has battled who, when and of what significance those battles were. Firstly there is a chord diagram here showing what matches have happened. If you want to watch them and manage to get your pointer in place over it you can click the cords and will be linked to the battles.

This one doesn't discriminate between big names and small, highly watched battles and hardly at all. It also doesn't give a clear idea of when each battle was released and so there is a calendar as well. The darker the color, higher the views are.

It is interesting to see how consistent KOTD have been through the years, a trend not all leagues follow as you will see in similar graphs I am working on for other big leagues.
