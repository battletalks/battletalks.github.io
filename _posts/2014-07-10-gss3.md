layout: post
title: GSS pt. 3

Today I wanted to add the same responsiveness as the Jekyll layout has. My idea was to do it similarly to how it was done in the video I linked to in the first post, that is, when the height of the screen would be larger than the width, then the navigation bar would move to the top.

For this GSS has `@if` and `@else` statements. So I wanted something that would say

{% highlight js %}
@if ::window[width] >= ::window[height] { 
{% endhighlight %}


I had to experiment with it quite a lot and frankly I am still not happy with it. Firstly it seems that the cross dependencies I put in last time

{% highlight js %}
width: == ::window[width] - #nav-bar[width];
{% endhighlight %}

Confused the plugin. The site looked correct at first, then I resized it down and the navigation bar went up. Enlarging the screen again seemed to not just move the screen to the original conditions but to minimize again and since the starting conditions were different I got the wrong result. This is what seems to have happened.

In an attempt to fix this I removed all dependencies from the `#content` div and `#nav-bar` div. The results are on the last page if you go through the GSS templates on the sidebar. If you however resize often enough you can see that the content in the navigation bar doesn't behave as it should. There are still cross dependencies there which will be a part of the next post.


{% highlight js %}
#nav-bar {
    background-color: black;
    color: white;
    height: == ::window[height];
    width: == ::window[width]/3;
    position: fixed !important;
}


#content {
    display: block;
    height: == ::window[height];
    ::[left] == #nav-bar[right];
    width: == ::window[width] - #nav-bar[width];
}
{% endhighlight %}
