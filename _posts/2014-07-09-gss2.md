layout: post
title: GSS pt. 2
---

To follow up with the layout I made in the last post I have put in the navigation bar and made the padding proportional to the window size, giving the optimization package some more use.

{% highlight js %}
#nav-bar-content {
    left: == #nav-bar[width]/10;
    top: == #nav-bar[height]/10;
    width: == .9*#nav-bar[width];
}
{% endhighlight %}

The page can be viewed through the gss tab on the sidebar.
